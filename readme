--Description--
An animation of snowflakes falling.

--Dependencies--
C++17 compiler
SFML 2.5.1

--Building--
This program uses SFML so it needs access to its headers and binaries. For example, here is part of my bash build script: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -L$sfml_bin_path -I$sfml_include_path -lsfml-graphics-2 -lsfml-window-2 -lsfml-system-2 $source_files -o app

--Running--
If you're using SFML in it's shared library form, then you'll need to make those binaries accessible to the program during runtime. This can be done either by copying those libaries into the same directory as the program or (in my case) temporarily adding the binaries' path to the system path while running the program. Afterwards, simply execute the executable, e.g. ./app.
